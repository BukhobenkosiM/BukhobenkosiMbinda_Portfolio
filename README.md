###  Reflection (STAR Technique)
 **Situation: As part of a group project for our coursework, we were tasked with developing a Gym Management System aimed at helping gyms manage their operations more efficiently. The system needed to include member registration, class scheduling, attendance logging, and real-time notifications.

**Task: I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend of the system. My task was to ensure that the user interface was responsive, intuitive, and aligned with the functionality required by the backend logic. I collaborated with two other team members who focused on the backend and database integration.

**Action: I used Vue.js to build interactive UI components such as forms for member registration, subscription views, class calendars, and dashboards. I regularly met with my teammates to align the frontend with the backend API, and participated in code reviews to ensure integration worked smoothly. I also conducted usability testing with mock users and applied feedback to improve the UI/UX.

**Result: The final product had a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that successfully interacted with the backend services. Users could easily register, track attendance, and view scheduled classes. Our project received positive feedback from our lecturer for its design consistency and functionality. I also gained hands-on experience with real-world frontend challenges like API integration, responsive layouts, and dynamic content rendering.
